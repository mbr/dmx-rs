DMX512 support
==============

The `dmx` crate supports [DMX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512) transmission in Rust through a trait, although transmission via [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter) on Linux is currently the only implementation available.

See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/dmx) for details.
